brief lesson about how to create your own git and push and .....
# 1. create a new repository from the github website.


open github website, click the plus sign on the top right corner, select new repository, 
then fill in the name of the repository, select public or private, then click create repository.
add readme file, add .gitignore file, add license, then click create repository.(or not, doesn't matter) I did had a conflict with the 
readme file, cuz I already had one and didn't realize that, and spend couple minutes on this silly issue.

# 2. create a new folder on your local computer, and open it with terminal in the vscode(or sth else).
click the third things on vscode, which looks like a net. It will hint u to download the git, then click yes. 
open terminal from the vscode, 
type 
git init

then type 
git remote add origin https://github.com/... the website of the repository. 
then type 
git pull origin master
, then type 
git add .
, then type 
git commit -m "first commit"
, then type 
git push -u origin master.   use the button not command!!! that't too silly to use command to push the first time. 
then type git status, then type git log, then type git branch, then type git checkout -b "new branch name", then type git push origin "new branch name".
then type git checkout master, then type git merge "new branch name", then type git push origin master.
